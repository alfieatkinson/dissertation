The implementation and testing of the sentiment analysis tool \citep{sentimentanalysistool} have yielded valuable insights into the functionality and performance of the developed software. The purpose of this chapter is to present the results of functionality testing, encompassing the evaluation of key components of the system, such as sentiment analysis, social media interfacing, data management, and the GUI.

Furthermore, it discusses the details of fulfillment for the previously outlined functional and non-functional requirements of the application from the requirements analysis, followed by further reflection on the development process and possible areas for improvement.
