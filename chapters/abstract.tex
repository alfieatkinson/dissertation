The rapid expansion of the internet and social media has led to customers increasingly relying on the internet as both a place for discussion and a news source. This has resulted in the need for companies to monitor and understand what is being said on social media about their brand. This paper covers the research, planning, development, and testing of an artefact, with the aim of harnessing natural language processing and deep-learning models to analyse the sentiment of online discourse. The development process will be critically analysed to provide key insight into the nuances of implementing such a system. The artefact aims to offer comprehensive understanding of the sentiment surrounding a brand, thereby enabling business owners to make informed decisions based on a holistic view of online discourse. The artefact's graphical user interface will provide intuitive access to these insights, facilitating effective monitoring and response to online sentiment.
